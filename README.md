# Learning microservices with GoLang

Learning microservices from Nic Jackson's YouTube series - Building Microservices with Go

First learning project that I'm publishing from my computer to GitHub.

This is just for learning purposes so I can learn how to use Git, GitHub, GoLang and others.

If you're interested to learn the same lesson check out Nick Jackson's (Building Microservices with Go) playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzBGi_n65iU&list=PLmD8u-IFdreyh6EUfevBcbiuCKzFk0EW_).
